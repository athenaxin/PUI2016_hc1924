Having read the Chapter 1,7,8,10 of the Statistics in a Nutshell. The analysis is fine to reproduce.

Confused about many things. 

PS: Bumped into problems with the git command when I need to pull and push homework at the last minute. It turns out it's because I upgraded may macbook from Yosemite to EI Capitan a few hours ago. Solved it by "xcode-select --install" which brings up a prompt to install the necessary command line tools.
